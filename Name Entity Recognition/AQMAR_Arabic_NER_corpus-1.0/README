AQMAR Arabic Wikipedia Named Entity Corpus

This dataset contains text extracted from a small corpus of Arabic Wikipedia articles and hand-annotated 
for named entities. It is described in the paper

  Behrang Mohit, Nathan Schneider, Rishav Bhowmick, Kemal Oflazer, and Noah A. Smith (2012),
  Recall-Oriented Learning of Named Entities in Arabic Wikipedia. Proceedings of EACL.

This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (see LICENSE).

The 28 articles are listed below, organized by domain. Each article was tagged by 1 of 2 annotators.
Annotators were encouraged to devise up to 3 article-specific entity classes to supplement the traditional 
four (PERson, ORGanization, LOCation, and generic MIScellaneous); these custom categories are 
summarized below each article.

Each data file consists of one line per token; each line has the Arabic token (UTF-8 encoding) 
followed by the BIO tag (e.g., B-MIS0 for the first word of a generic miscellaneous entity mention).
To see counts of entity positions (B, I, O) in each article, you can use the Bash command:

for f in *.txt; do paste <(cut -d' ' -f2 $f | grep '^B' | wc -l) <(cut -d' ' -f2 $f | grep '^I' | wc -l) <(cut -d' ' -f2 $f | grep '^O' | wc -l) <(echo $f); done

See the featureFiles subdirectory and its README for the featurized versions of these articles 
that were used in experiments.
